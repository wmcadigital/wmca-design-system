# WMCA Design System Patterns

Patterns are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.

Individual patterns can be used in multiple different patterns and contexts. For example, the text input component can be used to ask for an email address, a National Insurance number or someone’s name.

If you are using the WMCA Design System Frontend included in your build, the coded examples provided will render exactly as they do inside the Design System.
