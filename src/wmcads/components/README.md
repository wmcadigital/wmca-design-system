# WMCA Design System Components

Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.

Individual components can be used in multiple different patterns and contexts. For example, the text input component can be used to ask for an email address, a National Insurance number or someoneâ€™s name.

If you are using the WMCA Design System Frontend included in your build, the coded examples provided will render exactly as they do inside the Design System.
