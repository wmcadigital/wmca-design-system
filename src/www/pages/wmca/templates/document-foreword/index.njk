        <h1>Foreword</h1>
        <p>As well as being at the heart of the UKâ€™s
transport network, the West Midlands is at
another kind of crossroads; one at which there
is an opportunity to build back better from the
COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure we can carry
forward the reputation for economic success
the region has built in the new millennium
while improving the impacts of transport on
our towns, cities and local communities.</p>

<p>This green paper sets out the challenges and
opportunities facing our transport system to
inspire deliberation with the public over the
kind of transport system we want to see in the
future. The decisions we make now about how
we plan, invest in and manage our transport
system will affect us all, as well as deciding
what legacy we leave for future generations.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, the West Midlands has
seen substantial improvements to its transport
network. The West Midlands Metro has been
extended through Birmingham city centre
and a new line is under construction in the
Black Country, connecting Wednesbury with
Brierley Hill. We are improving our railways,
with improved and new stations planned at
Perry Barr, Darlaston, Willenhall, Aldridge and
the revival of the old Camp Hill line. Fleets
of electric buses are taking to the streets in
increasing numbers. And our active travel
revolution is well underway, with new cycling
and walking routes springing up across the
region. After decades of underinvestment, our
region is beginning to turn things around.</p>

<p>But significant challenges remain in tackling
the defining issues of our time, such as climate
change, air quality, our health, and now our
economic recovery from the pandemic. This
paper poses some difficult questions about
how we address these challenges. But it also
offers real hope that, with a collective effort,
we can create a West Midlands that leads the
way in tackling these issues. We have a strong
entrepreneurial and innovative heritage to build
on. By thinking and acting differently we can
create a place where transport improves the
opportunities available to all our residents.</p>

<p>A key aim of this paper is to understand what
our residents and communities want from their
transport network. Your views will inform our
new Local Transport Plan, due to be published
later in the year.
This green paper sets out five reasons why we
should consider changing the way we travel.
We call these our five Motives for Change.
These are focussed on creating a fairer, greener,
healthier, happier and more prosperous West
Midlands. In particular, we want to know how
the successive lockdowns have impacted our
relationship with the transport network and how
this should inform where we take the network in
the coming years.
This is the start of a conversation with
residents, organisations and businesses on
the kinds of changes we want to see in our
transport system and the trade-offs required.
So please engage with the prompts and issues
raised in this paper and let us know what you
think, so that together we can build a transport
network that will</p>
