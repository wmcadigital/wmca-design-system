{# About #}
<h2>About</h2>
{# What #}
<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>
  The autocomplete component is an input field that offers the user text suggestions as they type.<br/>
  This is often done by hitting an API endpoint with the users query when the user has finished typing.
</p>
<p>
  The autocomplete pattern is a combination of the <a href="/components/form-elements/" title="Input component" target="_self" class="wmcads-link">input</a> and <a href="/components/loader/" title="Loader component" target="_self" class="wmcads-link">loader</a> components.
</p>
{# When #}
<h3>When to use it?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>As a progressive enhancement to make a users journey shorter/easier when searching</li>
  <li>When you have a smaller data set/list that is quick to query</li>
  <li>When you want to ensure the user submits a relevant query/value</li>
</ul>
{# When not #}
<h3>When not to use it?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When you have a massive set of data, instead you should have an input/search that shows results after submission.</li>
  <li>Don't use this component as if it is a search box. Autocomplete is to suggest a value to a user via it's results not act as a results page for a search.</li>
</ul>

{# Default #}
<h2>Default state</h2>
<p>In its default state, the autcomplete component is made up of a text input with a search icon.</p>
<p>For best practice, ensure that the placeholder and aria-label describes what the autocompletes intended purpose is.</p>
<p>Notice that there is also a <code class="wmcads-website-inline-code">wmcads-loader</code> component nested within the autocomplete, more on that in the next section.</p>
