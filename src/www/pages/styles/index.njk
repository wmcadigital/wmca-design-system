<p>Make your service look and feel like WMCA Design System.</p>
<p>If you are using the WMCA Design System Prototype Kit or have WMCA Design System Frontend included in your build, the
  coded examples in the
  Design System will not need any additional styling.</p>
<p>If you need to apply styles manually, you should still follow existing WMCA Design System conventions. For
  example, do not assign
  new meanings to colours, do not change the style of buttons or adjust the thickness of borders on
  form inputs.</p>
