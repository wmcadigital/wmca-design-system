    <h2>Writing content for West Midlands Combined Authority</h2>
    <p>
      You should create all content with user-focused content design principles. This means content has an identified
      user need and is written in plain English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not use marketing speak - users will be visiting your website to perform a task (for example, buy a train ticket or find out about Swift cards). Your content shouldn’t try to sell them anything - instead, tell them the information they need to know in the simplest way possible. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Research has shown that both high literacy and low literacy users prefer plain English because it takes less time to read. Users won’t be on your website for fun - so make the experience quick and easy.
    </p>
    <p>

      <h3>Introducing West Midlands Combined Authority</h3>
    <p>If you’re talking about day-to-day services (bus, train or tram), you
      may need to make it clear that West Midlands Combined Authority does not run these.<br /><br />For example, you could say: "We don’t run the buses, trains or trams. We can point you in the right direction if you need help."
