# Creating pages

When the Design System is built it automatically generates files from `src/www` to the `build` folder. These are the files used to generate the [Design System front-end](https://wmcads.netlify.app/).

These pages are created from the files within `src/www/pages`. This is where you can import [components](../../../src/wmcads/components/README.md) or [patterns](../../../src/wmcads/patterns/README.md) found in `src/wmcads`.
